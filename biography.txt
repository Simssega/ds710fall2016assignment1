I am interested in data science because it seems so universally important in so many fields today.  I find it very interesting that as we are all creating and 
interacting with data every day and as time passes that data could become very useful in many different parts of our everyday lives.
When I decided I wanted to pursue a master's degree in data science I didn't have any programming experience.  I took a few community college classes last semester to prepare
this program.
My statistics experience is very similar to my programming experience.  I don't use it much in my current job but I majored in economics so I have a fair amount of classroom experience.
One of the programming classes I took focused on python, I don't however have any experience with R.
I am hoping to be able to understand what is possible when it comes to using python and R for data science.  I have a basic understanding of python but the application
to data science is something I am really looking forward to learning in the coming months.  
I feel a a little behind with some of the statistics because it's been a while since I have had to apply those concepts but I will study any additional information if necessary.
